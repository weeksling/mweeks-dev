## How I stopped overloading my tasks list with hundreds of to-dos in [[Roam Research]]
    Before, whenever I encountered a [[book]] I wanted [[ToRead]], or a [[course]] I wanted #[[ToBuy]], or a [[video]] I wanted #[[ToRecord]] , or a [[blog [[articles]]]] I wanted #[[ToWrite]], I would add it to my tasks list for the day, and add a TODO tag.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} I #need #ToBuy a salad bowl.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} So, I #need #ToBuy a kitchen island counter of some sort.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} I #need [[ToBuy]] new pants.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} #ToWrite a summary of all my favourite books from this year https://medium.com/p/4dba8a98a7f2/edit
        - {{[[TODO]]}} #ToWrite about this and other communities on [[Reddit]] that I want to infiltrate!
        - {{[[TODO]]}} This has inspired me #ToWrite [[Webflow for Developers: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly]] [[September 22nd, 2021]]
        - {{[[TODO]]}} #ToWrite transcribe [[Keeping our sky clean #essay]] from Morning Pages to Roam/Notion. [[August 13th, 2021]]
    That way I'd always remember to read it eventually. 
    Right?
    ## Right?
    No, of course not. Because each day, I'd encounter at least one thing I thought I might like #ToRead - often dozens. This made generating a list of #ToRead TODOs kind of useless.
        - {{[[query]]: {and: [[ToRead]]}}}
    When I read or  something worthwhile, I would inevitably generate #ideas for [[videos]] #[[ToRecord]] and so on. **Even when I completed a task, it generated more tasks**.
     My TODOs queries inevitably became even more cluttered, because these tasks accumulate from all of my potential tasks from #ToBuy #ToSell #ToRead #ToWrite #ToRecord #ToGo #ToText #ToCall #ToEdit #ToMeet #ToBike #ToSing - it adds up **quickly**
        - I started to realize it was a serious issue when viewing the [[TODO]] page and trying to search mentions, or adding a  [[TODO]] query without filtering would crash my [[Roam Research]] completely.

        - In fact, I have so many TODOs that when I try to open references, it completely crashes my [[Roam Research]]

    # Writing statements of intent, not tasks
        - Realizing I absolutely need to reduce the number of TODOs I have, I remembered some [[Getting Things Done]] principles. I realized that most [[Projects]] and [[Goals]] are obvious and explicit, but a lot of ideas we capture are not active projects.
        - Rather than 
        - And using TODO for only those things I need to **do next**
    # Putting it all together, I get a much simpler system that lets me capture and tag anything, while minimizing the number of [[TODOs]] I produce.
        - I want #ToBuy this [[Vim for CS Code ([[course]])]] I found by [[Joe Previte]]
            - ^^⬆️This is a statement, not a task.^^
            - {{[[TODO]]}} #[[Create a [[budget]]]] for $10 #ToBuy [[Vim for CS Code ([[course]])]] I found by [[Joe Previte]]
                - ^^⬆This is a task.^^
        - Whenever I encounter something I want to remember, I just write down an explicit statement that explains the action, opinion, idea, or though about some topic, or resources.
            - I use tags to categorize [[resources]], such as #[[books]], #[[articles]], #[[podcasts]], #[[tweets]], #[[videos]], 
    # Now, I on
