# Values, Practices, Goals system

This is a starter for this system that I am building. It is an organic offshoot of how I've recently begun to think about the fundamental building blocks of my life. I want to keep this as pragmatic and simple as I can, so that I can discuss it with anyone and understand it myself in idiomatic primitives.
    - If I find that this is difficult to communicate over, say, [[YouTube]], then I will try coming up with some cleverer name for it like everyone else did.
        - I like the style of [[Getting Things Done]] though, where he really just tries to get you to understand the simplest terms: [[Projects]], [[Tasks]], and some others ðŸ˜…
            - I really want #ToReRead [[Getting Things Done]] and take proper notes on it from start to finish.
Values are who we want to become. Practices are how we intentionally become them. Habits are the things we do automatically that we might want to cultivate, prune, and shape. Goals are the goalposts we use to chart our course.
# Values
    - [[Values]] are the things that I want in my life. They are organic, not ideal, and they come from real feelings that I come across. 
        - The come from:
            - The things that I [[shame]] myself for not being.
            - The things I feel [[guilty]] for not doing. 
            - The things that I am [[jealous]] of others having or doing.
            - The [[Things I enjoyed]].
            - The things that I learned.
        - I never set out to define these [[Values]] directly. My [[Journalling]] practice always starts from what's on my mind at the moment. Oftentimes, it's just me venting. Other times, it's a moment I feel I have to capture. Other times, it is very dry analysis and record of things that I am learning or researching or doing for work or for fun or otherwise.
            - It is during this [[Journalling]] practice and during my [[Review Regularly ([[Practices]])]] that I'll often find myself discovering themes that I want to capture somehow.
                - It actually started as these collections of [[Practices]] that I started this. I found I wanted to do things like [[daily writing ([[Practices]])]] and [[daily planning - 1 hour ([[Practices]])]]. I started to collect them together.
                - Then, recently during a [[Unstructured Sundays ([[Practices]])]] I watched something that made me to decide to start adding content directly to pages instead of having blank pages with references everywhere. 
                    - I decided to go into my [[practices]] page, and add each of them to the page. I started to [[Organize each day ([[Practices]])]] them together, and as I did, I realized I could give a name to each grouping. These became my [[Values]].

# Practices
  Practices are the things that we do regularly to maintain the shape of our soul. We practice those things that we want to truly define us. Our [[habits]] are who we are currently, our [[Practices]] are how we shape who we are intentionally.
My practices are in service of actualizing my [[Values]]. Eventually, my practices will form [[habits]], but continuing to apply practices with intentionality will maintain it. This is also the basis of [[living a disciplined life]].

# [[Cultivate a powerful, open presence ([[Values]])]]
    - [[gratitude ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[meditation daily ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Self-Comfort Visualization ([[daily [[Practices]]]])]]

# [[Maintain a healthy body ([[Values]])]]
    - [[Do yoga daily ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Track your nutrtition ([[Practices]])]]

# [[Live an intentional, self-directed life ([[Values]])]]
    - [[Organize each day ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[daily planning - 1 hour ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Review Regularly ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Unstructured Sundays ([[Practices]])]]

# [[[[Value]]: Learn and think, intentionally]]
    - [[daily reading ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[daily writing ([[Practices]])]]

# [[Maintain a healthy, loving relationship ([[Values]])]]
    - [[Date nights ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Thank you, not sorry ([[Practices]])]]
        - #aka [[feel grateful, not guilty]]

# [[Connect with my Family ([[Values]])]]

    - [[Call Brad every week ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Call Leo and Rose every week ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Send jokes to Chris and Sam ([[Practices]])]]
        - Almost [[habits]] at this point, but I might as well make it intentional, right?

    - [[Publish my writing ([[Practices]])]]
    - [[Make friends, meet and speak to people ([[Practices]])]]
