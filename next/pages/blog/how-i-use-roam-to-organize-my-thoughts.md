How I Use Roam To Organize My Thoughts

How I got started journalling
I have been an avid journaller for the greater part of a decade. In university, I was struggling to keep everything on my mind organized, so I bought several notebooks.
At first, I was really only using it to track workouts, my days, take notes from class, etc. I bounced around different versions of journalling without really being intentional about how I did it. My work and my life and my school all melted together (well, I was a student, so "work" is really referring to me spending time dreaming up startup ideas, or pontificating on the existential matters that were my dating life. I wasn't journalling about my job as a dish washer.)

At first, journalling was an entirely pragmatic way of studying and tracking things. I would take notes on class matter and then later try to use those notes to study. Eventually I learned that it was helpful to have separate notebooks for different topics, and pretty soon I had a notebook for everything.
I used my workout journal to record my workouts, and recorded each new PR.

Going digital
I experimented with digital, but not fully until I recently discovered Roam
I first really started experimenting with a more digital form of journalling when I was travelling in Thailand and running a small freelancing business. It actually started as a way for me to take notes on a variety of freelancing and sales courses and books I had started to take online.
At the time, this actually didn't seem very useful. I missed the tactile nature of using a pen and paper
Why use Roam?
Roam is the first note-taking app that I've found genuinely useful as a replacement for my hardcover journal.
I still use a physical journal for the raw shit
I actually continue to carry a bullet journal for off-the-cuff thinking as I go, but I like to use the digital version for anything that I think I will use long-term.
For example, I take notes now on everything that I consume and find interesting enough to possibly go back to in the future. I don't do this for everything (nor do I think I ever will), but I do think that this will make it easier to organize my thoughts.
Beyond just storing information though, I am also using Roam as my daily driver for most things.
Many of my projects and personal notes are in Roam. I've started to build systems such as my writing template, daily notes, weekly, quarterly reviews. I haven't fully grasped the full power of it yet, and I don't know what will stick, but I do know that I can build on it. And the simplicity of it is the biggest driver of that mentality.
Building systems with Roam
Roam Templates are incredibly simple, yet flexible and therefore powerful.
Already, I have a variety of templates that I use on a regular basis to make tasks easier and more consistent.
Using tags and titles to find information
I still haven't fully learned the power of the querying system for [[knowledge management system]] data retrieval, but the limited pieces that I have used have been immensely powerful.
Queries enable you to create reusable lists of information in templates.
I still use Notion too
Most of my projects and my [[personal financial statements]] are still stored in Notion. This is because Notion is great for very structured content, but kind of sucks for more loosely formatted or organic content.
I use Notion to manage many of my multi-stage projects like my podcast
For each new episode that I decide I want to start exploring goes into a Notion database.
That database includes stages for each part of the process:
Invite
Schedule
Record (scheduled)
Review recording
Send for Edit
Review the Edit
Schedule
Done

I don't I don't know how I would organize this sort of project in Roam, and frankly I don't want to shoe-horn it in. The right tool for the job, as they say.
I also use Notion for shared projects
Roam sucks at sharing notes with other people. If you try to share any link, it effectively allows someone to query your entire graph. This is a huge privacy concern, and so I think that everyone should always keep their graph entirely private.
So, when planning projects I typically use Notion.
For example, right now I am planning a camping trip, and I want to share that with others. I use Notion as a free way to share a database.
In fact, in 2023, I've now joined a company that uses Notion for its internal wiki, and I've come to value it even more as the final destination for sharing documentation and content with others.
