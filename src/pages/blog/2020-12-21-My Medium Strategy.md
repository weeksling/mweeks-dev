  I've always wanted to be a writer, but never felt the confidence to publish regularly. My writing never felt "perfect" to me, so I never published. Medium's Partner Program was the perfect game to stop this, and to build my writing habit. When you make work a game, you make it easy.

# Using Medium to gameify writing and build the habit of writing regularly.

I've enjoyed writing as long as I can remember. In public school, I would often write poetry, or notes to self in the agendas our school provided. [I've written in a journal every day for 6 years now](https://www.notion.so/I-ve-written-in-a-journal-every-day-for-6-years-now-ba26ba1a349b406e96b01a1356cc9cc0). But, I've never considered myself a writer.

The way schools expect you to write in a very specific, boring format certainly dampened some of thatâ€”as you've probably read in countless other blogsâ€”but not only was it draining to write about topics I didn't care about, but I often found that people ridiculed me for writing independently. A teenage boy carrying a journal around is bound to be called a few names. Needless to say, I wasn't very public about my writing.

In my journals, I've written down not only my vision and goals for whichever year, day, quarter, month, project that I was currently engaged with, but also detailed notes about my decision processes and ideas of the time. In some cases, I've gone so far as to even go back and reformat those notes into a structured essay that I could probably have shared. But until this year, I posted only a handful of half-assed articles that I wasn't even proud of. I'd kept the stuff I cared about close, because I was too concerned with perfecting it.

Basically, what I'm saying is writing is hard. And scary. And sometimes embarrassing.

It takes a lot of effort to write, which is why it helps to have as many little tricks available to use to motivate yourself as you can.

Today, I'll be talking about **Making it a game.** Specifically, I'll be talking about how Medium's Partner Program is the perfect way to gamify writing, and make the entire experience more fun.

The keys to making a good game:

- Some way of measuring a success of failure (points).
- Competition.
- A strategy that helps you compete better.
- An intrinsic personal benefit to the activity.


# Why I really started publishing my writing

Earlier this year, in June, I was inspired to start publishing some of my ideas. Not for some grandiose vision, but for selfish reasons: My girlfriend had started posting some of her articles on Medium, and showed me her analytics proudly one day. She hearning money off her writing after publishing just a few articles. 

> "Wait, you can make money writing on Medium?"

I was jealously thrust to action.

I decided to commit myself (loosely) to publishing weekly. The goal wasn't absolutely important, but it gave me a box to check and something to aim for. This was the start of building a game out of writing.

To make things easier, I started with some articles that I had already written and published elsewhere, just to test the articles. I took an article I had written on how I used git on my most of my projects, polished it up a bit, and reposted to Medium. 

It wasn't some viral hit, but it did get a few dozen views in the first several days! I even got a message from one of the larger publications "The Startup" asking me to publish it on their publication, which got it some more traffic!

After about a month, I was now a proud professional writer with a solid 1-digit monthly passive income ðŸ˜Ž

All kidding aside though, while I won't exactly quit my day job, it is incredibly motivating to get paid even a few dollars for my work. It was something to aim for.

## Friendly competition makes it more fun

By "competing" with my girlfriend, I was driven even more to keep publishing. We regularly leap-frog one anotherâ€”each of us accomplishing different milestones and then the other trying to keep it up. It makes it fun, because nobody wants to play alone!

# Medium's Partner Program lets you keep score

The truth is that having the green checkbox every day that I wrote for thirty minutes, or the satisfaction of publishing each week is great and all, but there's something missing to make writing a real game.

That's right, points.

And you know what the best points are?

Yup. Dollars. Because they are points that you can spend.

Having a ticker and the ability to earn money as your work gets more popular is incredibly motivating. Even when it is a few cents, it is an addicting feeling to see your earnings rise day by day. And the real kicker is when you post regularly, because as you start to publish more, you start to see more traction, and your old posts get more and more popular.

I see enough articles on Medium that compare how many articles one writes per week to the amount of money they earn in a month, as though pushing out more quantity is the only way to grow, but that's only a fraction of the game. That's like measuring the success of an MMO based on the number of rats you farm in a day. The real benefit is in getting enough experience from beating those rats that you can now beat the next dungeon.

> The real goal of a game isn't to simply grind it out, it's to enjoy the compounding effects of gradually getting better and better and being able to quantify that.

As I wrote more, I started to get traction.

That semantic commits article that I wrote got more popular as people discovered my profile. Medium started to promote my content a bit more, and I started to earn real money. In fact, last month I earned over $100. Not from new articles, but from the articles I had already published that had gotten some traction.

# Does gamification really work?

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: it depends...

You see, gamification has many different meetings. If you look at nearly any consumer application out there nowadays, and you can find countless attempts at gamifying everything from email, to fitness, to eating, to meditating. Most developers out there want to gamify their applications in order to increase people's use.

Honestly, most gamification is kind of bullshit. I don't really care that my to-do app records some sort of "karma" score when I do all my to-dos in a day. I'd honestly prefer to receive WAY fewer notifications from nearly all of my apps.

Except when it has a positive impact on my life. My favorite examples are fitness and health apps. 

MyFitnessPal keeps a streak count. It's not invasive, or overly goal oriented either. If you simply login, you get a day on your streak. Once you're there, if you log your food for the day then bonus for you!

What I liked about this feature the most was that it didn't require me to spam me with notifications. I'm a highly anxious person by nature, and so I personally [block all notifications on my phone to reduce the anxiety of being pinged](https://www.notion.so/block-all-notifications-on-my-phone-to-reduce-the-anxiety-of-being-pinged-ef6e00249b9e480eb73c9d030d63a426). Except for notifications that I really want, like my daily Readwise review, my calendar events, and perhaps a few other reminders I've added.

And, in this case, gamification really worked incredibly. I maintained more than 365 days of logging into MyFitnessPal in 2014, and as a result [I got my body fat down to 5% and felt incredible every day â€” until I didn't](https://www.notion.so/I-got-my-body-fat-down-to-5-and-felt-incredible-every-day-until-I-didn-t-087abd6d13fa4fdba48c1427821c10e2) (but that's another story). I didn't necessarily track my calories every day, but once I had for a month or so, I found myself continuing to log into the app every day regardless to keep my streak. As a result, I'd keep it up 50â€“60% of the time (way more than I would have otherwise).

So, does gamification really work? Yeah, sometimes.

# Creating a gameplay strategy

Every good game requires a good strategy in order to really improve. Whether that's to just grind low-level rats for days, to complete the core story quests, or to farm dungeons and maximize your gear efficiency, the point is to have a strategy. This can be as simple or as complex as you'd like, and helps to start slow and adapt as you grow.

When you want to be competitive, you need a strategy to compete with. Simple as that.

Writing on Medium is no different. Everyone has a strategy, whether that's implicit (writing when you feel like it), or explicit (as I'll show you below). Personally, I think you should spend some time explicitly defining your strategy as you get into it (but, of course, not so much time that you don't get started!).

## Keeping it simpleâ€”tracking my ideas

Once money was involved, I started to be inspired (funny how that works, eh?). I started to write down more of the topics I thought I could write. 

I started off putting them in my journal, where I write every day. This works great for coming up with new ideas, because I always have it on hand and when an idea comes up, I can quickly toss it in!

![My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/PXL_20201221_164055440.jpg](My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/PXL_20201221_164055440.jpg)

The great thing about pen and paper is that it is free-form and ephemeral. It makes you naturally more creative. It's okay to repeat yourself, because it doesn't matter as much.

I still use my journals to brainstorm on a regular basis, and even during my daily journaling practice, I'll often come up with new ideas.

However, as I continued on this journey, I quickly realized that I would never complete any given list of ideas. After I'd been consistently working on my writing for a few weeks, my list had grown to several separate pages, eventually even spreading across multiple notebooks. I decided it was time to get organized and to start establishing a system to make writing easier.

## Tracking it in a simple system

I had started to use Notion earlier in the year when I started working at a new agency that kept all of their documentation, project planning, employee handbook, and standard operating procedures in it.

I started my first real database, and created it as a Kanban board view! At first it was just three columns: Idea, Writing, Editing, Submitted, Published. Something like this:

![My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/Screen_Shot_2020-12-21_at_11.58.53_AM.png](My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/Screen_Shot_2020-12-21_at_11.58.53_AM.png)

This is kanban at its finest. Simple and easy. The goal is to track: To Do, In Progress, Done.

Of course, with writing you need to separate writing and editing. Writing is a generative process, in which you want to simply put down as much as you can. Editing is an entirely separate step, where you can polish your words, trim off the fat, and juice up the parts that really matter. After that it should be ready to publish and start sharing with folks.

The reason I show you this is to be clear that it's ideal to keep things simple at first. You crawl, then walk, and then run. Nobody starts off sprinting.

But of course, once you can walk or run, you aren't exactly going to crawl around anymore.  It's just not efficient.

## Adapting my strategy with new information

As I continued to write, I realized that there were many more steps that I hadn't originally considered. So, I added some categories to my kanban board, and even added some pretty images to inspire me:

![My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/Screen_Shot_2020-12-21_at_12.18.10_PM.png](My%20Medium%20Strategy%20bb5be19e1d9e4e22abb9e8e009561eab/Screen_Shot_2020-12-21_at_12.18.10_PM.png)

My stages now are: Idea, Cooking / Gathering, Need To Build Something, Ready To Write, Write this Week, Ready to Edit, Submitted / Queued, and Published
First, I realized that some ideas were just ideas, and others were ready to act on next, but many of them needed something more, whether that was more research, or just some thinking time. I decided to categorize these as **Cooking / Gathering** â€” meaning that I am gathering ingredients for the final recipe.

Because I also write technical articles sometime, I realized several of my articles would be blocked until I had time to sit down and code, so I created the **Need to build something** category.

The other thing I had realized is that Medium publications were a key part of a good Medium strategy. I had early on been invited by some great publications such as The Startup, and had seen a *massive* boost from their audiences. So, I added another step for **Submitted / Queued** to track things until they could actually be published.

# Try it out!
